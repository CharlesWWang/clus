""" Provides an implementation of the Hungarian (also called Munkres or Kuhn-Munkres) algorithm, used for solving the
Assignment Problem in cubic time.


Assignment Problem
==================

Let *C* be an *n* x *n* matrix representing the costs of each of *n* workers to perform any of *n* jobs. The
assignment problem is to assign jobs to workers in a way that minimizes the total cost. Since each worker can perform
only one job and each job can be assigned to only one worker the assignments represent an independent set of the
matrix *C*.

One way to generate the optimal set is to create all permutations of the indexes necessary to traverse the matrix so
that no row and column are used more than once. For instance, given this matrix (expressed in Python):

    matrix = [[5, 9, 1],
              [10, 3, 2],
              [8, 7, 4]]

You could use this code to generate the traversal indexes:

    def permute(a, results):
        if len(a) == 1:
            results.insert(len(results), a)

        else:
            for i in range(0, len(a)):
                element = a[i]
                a_copy = [a[j] for j in range(0, len(a)) if j != i]
                subresults = []
                permute(a_copy, subresults)
                for subresult in subresults:
                    result = [element] + subresult
                    results.insert(len(results), result)

    results = []
    permute(range(len(matrix)), results) # [0, 1, 2] for a 3x3 matrix

After the call to permute(), the results matrix would look like this:

    [[0, 1, 2],
     [0, 2, 1],
     [1, 0, 2],
     [1, 2, 0],
     [2, 0, 1],
     [2, 1, 0]]

You could then use that index matrix to loop over the original cost matrix and calculate the smallest cost of the
combinations::

    n = len(matrix)
    minval = sys.maxsize
    for row in range(n):
        cost = 0
        for col in range(n):
            cost += matrix[row][col]
        minval = min(cost, minval)

    print minval

While this approach works fine for small matrices, it does not scale. It executes in O(*n*!) time: Calculating the
permutations for an *n* x *n* matrix requires *n*! operations. For a 12x12 matrix, that's 479,001,600 traversals.
Even if you could manage to perform each traversal in just one millisecond, it would still take more than 133 hours to
perform the entire traversal. A 20x20 matrix would take 2,432,902,008,176,640,000 operations. At an optimistic
millisecond per operation, that's more than 77 million years.

The Munkres algorithm runs in O(*n* ^3) time, rather than O(*n*!). This module provides an implementation of that
algorithm.

This version is based on http://www.public.iastate.edu/~ddoty/HungarianAlgorithm.html.

This version was written for Python by Brian Clapper from the (Ada) algorithm at the above web site. (The
`Algorithm::Munkres`` Perl version, in CPAN, was clearly adapted from the same web site.)
It was then rewritten by Nicolas BizzozzÃ©ro in numpy with full vectorization for performance enhancement.


Usage
=====

Construct a Munkres object::

    from munkres import Munkres

    m = Munkres()

Then use it to compute the lowest cost assignment from a cost matrix. Here's a sample program:

    from munkres import Munkres

    matrix = [[5,  9, 1],
              [10, 3, 2],
              [8,  7, 4]]
    m = Munkres()
    indexes = m.compute(matrix)
    print("Lowest cost through this matrix:")

    total = 0
    for row, column in indexes:
        value = matrix[row][column]
        total += value
        print '(%d, %d) -> %d' % (row, column, value)
    print 'total cost: %d' % total

Running that program produces:

    Lowest cost through this matrix:
    [5, 9, 1]
    [10, 3, 2]
    [8, 7, 4]
    (0, 0) -> 5
    (1, 1) -> 3
    (2, 2) -> 4
    total cost=12

The instantiated Munkres object can be used multiple times on different matrices.


Non-square Cost Matrices
========================

The Munkres algorithm assumes that the cost matrix is square. However, it's possible to use a rectangular matrix if you
first pad it with 0 values to make it square. This module automatically pads rectangular cost matrices to make them
square.


Calculating Profit, Rather than Cost
====================================

The cost matrix is just that: A cost matrix. The Munkres algorithm finds the combination of elements (one from each
row and column) that results in the smallest cost. It's also possible to use the algorithm to maximize profit. To do
that, however, you have to convert your profit matrix to a cost matrix. The simplest way to do that is to subtract all
elements from a large value. For example::

    from munkres import Munkres

    matrix = [[5, 9, 1],
              [10, 3, 2],
              [8, 7, 4]]
    cost_matrix = []
    for row in matrix:
        cost_row = []
        for col in row:
            cost_row += [sys.maxsize - col]
        cost_matrix += [cost_row]

    m = Munkres()
    indexes = m.compute(cost_matrix)
    print('Highest profit through this matrix:')

    total = 0
    for row, column in indexes:
        value = matrix[row][column]
        total += value
        print '(%d, %d) -> %d' % (row, column, value)

    print 'total profit=%d' % total

Running that program produces::

    Highest profit through this matrix:
    [5, 9, 1]
    [10, 3, 2]
    [8, 7, 4]
    (0, 1) -> 9
    (1, 0) -> 10
    (2, 2) -> 4
    total profit=23
